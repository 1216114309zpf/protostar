int this problem, I modidied the source code a little.

it seems that the main function's return address can not be modified, thus I add a wrapper function to modify the wrapper function's address.

to exploit the stack overflow properly. address space randomizaiton should be turned off:
     su root
     sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0

just modifying wrapper's return address will make a segmentation fault after the execution of fucntion win(),since after win() return, the return address is invalid.

thus we add exit()'s address after win()'s address in the stack, thus when win() returns, it jumps to exit()'s address and exit() does not return.
