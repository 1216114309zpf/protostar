int this problem, I modidied the source code a little.

it seems that the main function's return address can not be modified, thus I add a wrapper function to modify the wrapper function's address.

to exploit the stack overflow properly. address space randomizaiton should be turned off:
     su root
     sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0
