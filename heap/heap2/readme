the fault happens here:
    auth = malloc(sizeof(auth));
auth is defined as "struct auth*", the allocated space should be sizeof(struct auth), but here it uses sizeof(auth), auth is just a pointer, its size is 4,while struct auth's size is 36.

The strdup() function returns a pointer to a  new  string  which  is  a duplicate  of the string s.  Memory for the new string is obtained with malloc(3), and can be freed with free(3).

thus when    service = strdup(line + 7);   is executed, it will allocate space adjacent to the heap space allocate to auth, and auth will regard some of service's space as its own.

use ltrace we can easily see that space allocated to auth is 16, and the distance between the begining of struct auth object and auth->auth is 32, thus as 17th~20th byte in service space will be regarded as auth->auth by auth.

therefore, following input should work:
./heap2
auth zpf
service aaaabbbbccccddddeeee
login
