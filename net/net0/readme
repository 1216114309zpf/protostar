In this level we are presented with an integer and we have to reply the server with a little endian version of the integer.

We use python and the struct module to do the conversion 

struct.pack("<I",num) //this function change num to a little endian unsigned int 

for the C solution, compile with "-m32" flag to compile it into a 32 bit program
    gcc -m32 solution0.c -o solution0
