this problem just do the opposite of net0

we are presented with an integer in little endian representation and we have to send back se ASCII representation

struct.unpack("<I",wanted)  //unpack the string wanted as an unsigned integer.

for the c solution, compile it with "-m32" flag
    gcc -m32 solution1.c -o solution1
